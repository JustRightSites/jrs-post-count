<h2>JRS Post Count</h2>

<strong>Perhaps a better name</strong> would be "hit counter" because that's what this is.  An old fashioned hit counter that includes a very basic, but sortable report accessible via the admin menu link "Post Count Report."

<strong>There is NO export,</strong>  printing or pagination included at this time.

<strong>Once activated,</strong>  a table will be created called {$wpdb->prefix}jrs_post_counts.  The table remains if the plugin is deactivated or deleted.

<strong>The 'template_redirect' action</strong>  is used to count each page load.

<strong>No statistical or demographic data</strong>  related to the site visitor is stored.  Just the hit count, by post and page load including the post_title, ID and last hit date.
